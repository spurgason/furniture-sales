# furniture-sales

This application is an e-commerce portal for acquiring used furniture from users at a price, refurbishing the items and selling them off. 
Users can sign-up for an account and profile to post used furniture items for purchase by the company or other users.
This application will display used furniture currently being sold by the company or individual users.
Users can search for furniture items and checkout on a secure payment page. 
Once payment is successful, the expected time of product arrival must be communicated to the user via email as well as displayed on the order page.
<!-- Users must also be able to sell used furniture to the company.  -->
Users must be able to upload pictures of the items they intend to sell. Based on the images, company admins must be able to decide whether to buy or not.

## Lines 3-9 is the general idea but doesn't make complete sense.

Are we a company that has a website for buying used furniture, refurbishing it and then reselling? Or, are we not a company, just a website created to host (like FB marketplace, let-it-go, etc.) user accounts, post furniture items for sale or purchase furniture items? Or both?
Regardless of what we decide lines 6-9 must take place to satisfy the project 3 requirements.
